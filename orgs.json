We use words as tools to articulate feelings and ideas, resolve conflicts, comprehend academic lessons, apply for jobs and simply be informed about the world around us.\r\n\r\nNormal speech and language development is often taken for granted, but it is a cornerstone for academic, social and professional success. Speaking and reading don\u2019t just apply during English or language lessons; they are the basic means required for every academic subject and social interaction. And if a child has poorly developed speech and vocabulary, learning to read becomes a nearly impossible task.\r\n\r\nSince 1988, Leap Learning Systems has worked to close this learning gap. Our highly experienced staff of speech-language pathologists and educators brings a holistic knowledge of the cognitive, biological, social, educational and communicative dimensions of language development. From this unique vantage point, Leap Learning Systems creates and implements literacy and language development programs that prepare children to navigate successfully the challenges and opportunities in life.","url":"http://leaplearningsystems.org/","logo_url":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/kSNQrtMtTnCJsnqQbDUt","created_at":"2014-06-18T18:40:52Z","updated_at":"2014-06-30T18:27:58Z","api_enabled":false},{"id":132,"name":"Lighthouse Youth Center","description":"All youth ages 10 \u2013 18 are welcome to use the Lighthouse Youth Center free of charge.
